# Sophia AI Orchestrator: Roadmap to Badass MVP

**Objective:** This document outlines a detailed roadmap to address the gaps identified in the gap analysis and provide a clear path to achieving the "badass MVP Sophia."

## Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure & Centralized Secret Management (1-2 Weeks)

**Goal:** Establish a secure, scalable, and centralized foundation for Sophia's operations.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Implement Centralized Secret Management:**
        *   Set up Pulumi ESC or HashiCorp Vault for centralized secret management.
        *   Migrate all existing secrets from Fly.io and local environment variables to the new secret manager.
        *   Refactor all code to securely retrieve secrets from the centralized manager.
    *   **Refactor Infrastructure with Pulumi:**
        *   Refactor the existing Pulumi code to be more modular and reusable.
        *   Use Pulumi to manage all infrastructure resources, including databases, servers, and networking.
        *   Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate infrastructure deployments.

## Phase 2: Full Service Integration & Action-Taking Capabilities (2-3 Weeks)

**Goal:** Enable Sophia to seamlessly connect to and affect change in external services.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Implement Full Service Integrations:**
        *   Refactor all existing service integrations to be fully functional and production-ready.
        *   Implement new integrations with key services like Lambda, OpenRouter, and others as needed.
    *   **Develop Action-Taking Capabilities:**
        *   Develop and implement action-taking capabilities for each integrated service.
        *   Enable Sophia to perform tasks like creating resources, updating configurations, and triggering deployments.

## Phase 3: Autonomous Development & Self-Improvement (3-4 Weeks)

**Goal:** Empower Sophia to autonomously design, develop, commit, push, and deploy new integrations and improvements.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Implement a Robust CI/CD Pipeline:**
        *   Implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
        *   Automate the entire development and deployment process, from code generation to production deployment.
    *   **Develop a Self-Improvement Loop:**
        *   Implement a feedback loop that allows Sophia to learn from her mistakes and improve her development process over time.
        *   Use reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques to enable Sophia to learn and adapt.
    *   **Implement a Testing Framework:**
        *   Implement a comprehensive testing framework that allows Sophia to test her own code before deploying it to production.

## Phase 4: Advanced LLM Access & Performance Monitoring (2-3 Weeks)

**Goal:** Provide Sophia with access to the best and most suitable LLM models for each task.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Implement Dynamic Model Selection:**
        *   Implement a dynamic model selection system that can adapt to new models and changes in model performance.
        *   Use A/B testing or other techniques to identify the best-performing models for each task.
    *   **Implement Performance Monitoring:**
        *   Implement a performance monitoring system that can track the performance of the different models.
        *   Use the performance data to optimize the model selection process.

## Phase 5: MCP Server & AI-Friendly Ecosystem (3-4 Weeks)

**Goal:** Build a robust and scalable AI-friendly ecosystem for Sophia.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Develop a Sophisticated MCP Server Architecture:**
        *   Develop and implement a more sophisticated MCP server architecture.
        *   Provide the level of contextualized visibility and indexing required for an advanced AI orchestrator.
    *   **Implement a Robust Database Architecture:**
        *   Implement a more robust and scalable database architecture.
        *   Use a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to handle the large amounts of data generated by Sophia.
    *   **Implement a Dedicated Memory Management System:**
        *   Implement a dedicated memory management system that can efficiently store and retrieve the information needed by Sophia to perform her tasks.
