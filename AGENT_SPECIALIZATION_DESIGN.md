# SOPHIA Intel - Agent Specialization Architecture

## Current Problem
The existing 4-agent coding swarm (Planner, Coder, Reviewer, Coordinator) is being used for all tasks including web research, which is inappropriate. Different task types require different agent specializations.

## Proposed Multi-Domain Agent Architecture

### 1. Coding Swarm (Current - Enhanced)
**Purpose**: Software development, code generation, debugging, deployment
**Agents**:
- **Code Planner**: Architecture design, technical planning
- **Code Generator**: Implementation, coding, scripting
- **Code Reviewer**: Quality assurance, testing, optimization
- **Code Coordinator**: Integration, deployment, version control

### 2. Research Swarm (New)
**Purpose**: Web research, information gathering, data analysis
**Agents**:
- **Research Planner**: Query formulation, search strategy
- **Web Searcher**: Search execution, source discovery
- **Data Analyzer**: Information synthesis, fact verification
- **Research Coordinator**: Result compilation, source citation

### 3. Business Intelligence Swarm (New)
**Purpose**: Business analysis, market research, strategic planning
**Agents**:
- **Market Analyst**: Industry analysis, competitive intelligence
- **Financial Analyst**: Financial modeling, ROI analysis
- **Strategy Planner**: Business planning, recommendations
- **BI Coordinator**: Report generation, presentation

### 4. Content Creation Swarm (New)
**Purpose**: Writing, documentation, presentations, media
**Agents**:
- **Content Planner**: Structure, outline, strategy
- **Content Writer**: Text generation, editing
- **Content Reviewer**: Quality, accuracy, style
- **Content Coordinator**: Publishing, formatting, distribution

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Separate Research Capabilities
```python
class ResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self, name, search_tools):
        self.name = name
        self.search_tools = search_tools  # Web search, API access, etc.
        self.knowledge_base = None
    
    async def search_web(self, query):
        # Implement web search capabilities
        pass
    
    async def analyze_sources(self, sources):
        # Implement source analysis and synthesis
        pass

class WebSearcher(ResearchAgent):
    async def execute_search(self, research_query):
        # Specialized web search implementation
        pass

class DataAnalyzer(ResearchAgent):
    async def synthesize_findings(self, raw_data):
        # Specialized data analysis implementation
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Task Routing System
```python
class TaskRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.swarms = {
            'coding': CodingSwarm(),
            'research': ResearchSwarm(),
            'business': BusinessSwarm(),
            'content': ContentSwarm()
        }
    
    def route_task(self, task_description):
        # Analyze task and route to appropriate swarm
        task_type = self.classify_task(task_description)
        return self.swarms[task_type]
    
    def classify_task(self, description):
        # AI-powered task classification
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Cross-Swarm Collaboration
```python
class SwarmOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_swarms = {}
        self.shared_context = {}
    
    async def execute_complex_task(self, task):
        # Coordinate multiple swarms for complex tasks
        # e.g., Research swarm gathers info, then Coding swarm implements
        pass
```

## Enhanced SOPHIA API Endpoints

### New Specialized Endpoints
- `/api/v1/research/execute` - Research swarm tasks
- `/api/v1/coding/execute` - Coding swarm tasks  
- `/api/v1/business/execute` - Business intelligence tasks
- `/api/v1/content/execute` - Content creation tasks
- `/api/v1/orchestrate/execute` - Multi-swarm coordination

### Task Classification
- Automatic task routing based on content analysis
- User can specify swarm type explicitly
- Fallback to general orchestrator for complex tasks

## Benefits of Specialization

1. **Appropriate Tools**: Each swarm has tools suited to its domain
2. **Better Performance**: Specialized agents perform better in their domain
3. **Scalability**: Can add new swarms for new domains
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Efficiency**: No wasted effort using wrong agents for tasks

## Next Steps

1. Implement Research Swarm with web search capabilities
2. Enhance existing Coding Swarm with better coordination
3. Add task classification and routing system
4. Test specialized swarms independently
5. Implement cross-swarm collaboration for complex tasks
