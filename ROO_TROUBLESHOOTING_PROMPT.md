## URGENT: Custom Modes Still Not Loading Despite Multiple Fixes

We have taken several corrective actions on the `.roomodes` file to resolve validation errors:

1. **Added missing required fields**: Added `roleDefinition` and converted `groups` to arrays of objects with `slug` fields (proper schema format).
2. **Eliminated UTF-8 encoding corruption**: Removed all emoji characters from mode names. File now shows as clean ASCII text instead of problematic UTF-8 Unicode.
3. **Committed and pushed changes**: Commit `39b22b6` on `main` branch, verified only one `.roomodes` file exists in project.

**File verification completed:**
- **Location**: `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`
- **Format**: ASCII text (was UTF-8 Unicode with corrupted emojis)
- **Size**: 6,978 bytes
- **Modified**: 2025-08-14 16:53:53 UTC
- **Git commit**: 39b22b6e24928f2838f868ba7b7c95395cf4377e
- **No duplicate/backup files found**

**Despite these comprehensive fixes, Roo still reports validation errors for custom modes, and persistent "Command Execution Warning" about VSCode terminal integration appears.**

## CRITICAL INVESTIGATION NEEDED:

### 1. **Verify Roo's File Loading Path**
- Confirm which `.roomodes` file path Roo is actually using
- Check if Roo is reading from the correct `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`
- Verify file modification timestamp matches our latest commit (16:53 UTC)
- Ensure Roo isn't using a cached or alternate file location

### 2. **Clear Internal Caches**
- Execute any available "Reload Modes", "Refresh Configuration", or "Clear Cache" commands
- If Roo has internal mode caching, force a complete reload
- Check if restarting the Roo extension/process resolves the issue

### 3. **Schema Validation Deep Dive**
- Confirm Roo is parsing the corrected ASCII file (not a cached UTF-8 version)
- Verify the object-based groups schema is being recognized:
  ```yaml
  groups:
    - slug: "architect"
    - slug: "code"
    - slug: "debug"
  ```
- Check if there are any remaining encoding issues or hidden characters

### 4. **VSCode Terminal Integration Warning**
- Investigate persistent "Command Execution Warning" about VSCode terminal shell integration
- Determine if this is blocking mode loading or causing configuration conflicts
- Suggest whether to:
  - Disable shell integration in Roo Code settings â†’ Terminal
  - Adjust VSCode terminal settings
  - Follow troubleshooting link provided in warning

### 5. **Diagnostic Commands**
Please run these diagnostic commands and report results:

```bash
# Verify current working directory and file
pwd && ls -la .roomodes

# Confirm file is clean ASCII
file .roomodes

# Validate YAML structure
python -c "import yaml; data=yaml.safe_load(open('.roomodes').read()); print(f'Modes: {len(data[\"customModes\"])}'); print('Names:', [m['name'] for m in data['customModes']])"

# Check for any conflicting files
find . -name "*roomode*" -o -name "*.roomode*" | head -10
```

### 6. **Expected Mode Names**
Roo should now recognize these 5 clean custom modes:
- **SOPHIA Architect** (architecture design, code reviews)
- **SOPHIA Feature Builder** (new feature development) 
- **SOPHIA Test Engineer** (testing, quality assurance)
- **SOPHIA Operator** (DevOps, infrastructure)
- **SOPHIA Debugger** (troubleshooting, diagnostics)

## NEXT STEPS IF ISSUE PERSISTS:

1. **Enable debug logging** for Roo custom mode parsing
2. **Force reload** configuration without cache
3. **Check Roo version compatibility** with current schema format
4. **Consider temporary reinstallation** if caching issues persist
5. **Verify Codespaces environment** isn't interfering with file access

## CRITICAL QUESTION:
**What specific error messages is Roo currently showing for the custom modes, and is Roo definitely reading from the correct ASCII `.roomodes` file at `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`?**

Please investigate these points systematically and provide specific diagnostic results.
