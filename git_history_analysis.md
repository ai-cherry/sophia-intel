### Branches Requiring Attention
⚠️ **main (local)**: 24 commits behind origin/main
- Local main needs to be updated with: `git checkout main && git pull`

## Key Findings

1. **100% GitHub Synchronization:** All commits have been successfully pushed to GitHub. There are no local-only commits.

2. **Active Development:** The repository shows intense initial development with 27 commits in just 2 days.

3. **Branch Strategy:** The project uses feature branches effectively:
   - Multiple feature branches for different aspects (autonomous-agent, esc-bootstrap, initial-setup, integration)
   - A separate notion branch with minimal activity

4. **Main Branch Divergence:** The local main branch is significantly behind the remote (24 commits), likely because development has been happening on feature branches that were merged to remote main via pull requests.

5. **Pending Work:** 9 files with uncommitted changes suggest ongoing development work that hasn't been committed yet.

## Recommendations

1. **Update Local Main:** Run `git checkout main && git pull` to sync the local main branch
2. **Commit Pending Changes:** Review and commit the 9 files with changes
3. **Branch Cleanup:** Consider deleting merged feature branches if they're no longer needed
