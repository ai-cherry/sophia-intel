# SOPHIA Functionality Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Analyze Current Limitations and Design Action Framework

- [x] **Analyze current limitations:** Document why SOPHIA is only providing chat responses instead of executing real actions. Create `SOPHIA_FUNCTIONALITY_ANALYSIS.md`.
- [x] **Design action framework:** Propose a new architecture that enables SOPHIA to execute actions based on user intent. This will involve creating a new `ActionEngine` class and defining a clear action execution lifecycle.
- [x] **Define action schemas:** Create a set of standardized action schemas for each capability (research, code, business, deployment) to ensure consistent and reliable execution.

## Phase 2: Configure API Keys and External Service Integrations

- [ ] **Configure research API keys:** Set up Fly secrets for Serper, Tavily, and ZenRows.
- [ ] **Configure GitHub API access:** Create a GitHub PAT with repo permissions and set it as a Fly secret.
- [ ] **Configure business platform APIs:** Set up API keys and OAuth for Gong, Asana, Linear, and Notion.

## Phase 3: Implement Real Research Capabilities

- [ ] **Integrate research APIs:** Update the research service to use the configured API keys and fetch live data.
- [ ] **Implement data parsing and summarization:** Process the raw data from research APIs and provide a concise summary.
- [ ] **Test and validate research functionality:** Ensure the weather query returns accurate results with sources.

## Phase 4: Build Autonomous Code Generation and GitHub Integration

- [ ] **Implement file system operations:** Give SOPHIA the ability to read, write, and modify files in the repository.
- [ ] **Integrate GitHub API:** Use the configured PAT to create branches, commit changes, and open pull requests.
- [ ] **Test and validate code generation:** Verify that SOPHIA can create the `hello_world()` function and open a PR.

## Phase 5: Create Business Platform Integrations

- [ ] **Integrate Gong API:** Fetch call summaries and transcripts.
- [ ] **Integrate Asana, Linear, and Notion APIs:** Create tasks, issues, and pages with the summarized Gong data.
- [ ] **Test and validate business chain:** Ensure the end-to-end workflow is working correctly.

## Phase 6: Implement Deployment and Infrastructure Operations

- [ ] **Integrate Fly.io API:** Give SOPHIA the ability to deploy, promote, and roll back services.
- [ ] **Implement staging and production environments:** Create separate configurations for staging and production deployments.
- [ ] **Test and validate deployment cycle:** Verify that SOPHIA can deploy the research service to staging, promote to production, and roll back.

## Phase 7: Test and Validate All Real Capabilities End-to-End

- [ ] **Run all 5 smoke tests** from the mega-prompt.
- [ ] **Capture all artifacts** (screenshots, links, journal entries).
- [ ] **Verify all functionality** is working as expected.

## Phase 8: Deploy and Document the Fully Functional SOPHIA System

- [ ] **Deploy the final version** of SOPHIA to production.
- [ ] **Create comprehensive documentation** for the new architecture and functionality.
- [ ] **Tag and protect** the final version as v5.0.0.
