# Implementation and Rollout Plan

This document provides a step-by-step plan for implementing and rolling out the autonomous AI agent. The plan is divided into five sprints, following a "crawl, walk, run" methodology.

## Sprint 1: Foundational Setup

**Goal:** Deploy and configure the core infrastructure and the first service connector.

1.  **Deploy HashiCorp Vault:** Provision a Vault server.
2.  **Configure Vault:**
    - Create the `AppRole` for the agent.
    - Configure the KV secrets engine.
    - Store the GitHub App's private key (to be created next).
3.  **Create GitHub App:** Create the GitHub App with the permissions defined in the security architecture.
4.  **Deploy Temporal:** Provision a Temporal cluster.
5.  **Develop Initial Orchestrator:** Create a "hello world" Temporal workflow to verify the Temporal deployment.
6.  **Develop GitHub Connector:** Implement the first service connector for GitHub, with an initial action to read a file from a repository.

## Sprint 2: First End-to-End Read-Only Workflow

**Goal:** Implement a simple, non-destructive, end-to-end workflow to validate the integration of the core components.

1.  **Implement `read_file` Workflow:** Create a Temporal workflow that takes a repository and file path as input and returns the file's content.
2.  **Integrate Vault:** The workflow must securely fetch the GitHub App credentials from Vault.
3.  **Deploy Observability Stack:** Provision Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo.
4.  **Instrument Workflow:** Add structured logging, metrics, and traces to the `read_file` workflow.
5.  **Develop Sandboxed Environment v1:** Create the basic Docker image and container runtime configuration for the sandboxed execution environment.

## Sprint 3: Adding Destructive Actions & HITL

**Goal:** Implement a workflow with a destructive action, protected by the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval gateway.

1.  **Develop Pulumi Connector:** Implement the connector for `pulumi preview` and `pulumi up`.
2.  **Store Pulumi Token in Vault:** Add the `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` to Vault's KV secrets engine.
3.  **Implement HITL Gateway:** Develop the service that integrates with Slack (or another chat platform) to send approval requests.
4.  **Implement `pulumi_preview_and_up` Workflow:** This workflow will:
    a. Run `pulumi preview` in the sandboxed environment.
    b. Send the plan to the HITL gateway for approval.
    c. If approved, run `pulumi up`.
5.  **Integrate HITL:** The workflow must successfully pause and wait for the HITL gateway's response.

## Sprint 4: Expanding Capabilities

**Goal:** Add connectors for the remaining managed services.

1.  **Develop Lambda Labs Connector:** For provisioning and managing instances.
2.  **Develop Neon, Redis, Qdrant, Estuary Connectors:** For managing these services.
3.  **Configure Dynamic Secrets for Neon:** Configure Vault's Database Secrets Engine to generate dynamic credentials for Neon (Postgres).
4.  **Implement Test Workflows:** Create a simple workflow for each new connector to validate its functionality.

## Sprint 5: Autonomous Operation & Phased Rollout

**Goal:** Implement a fully autonomous, complex workflow and begin a safe, phased rollout.

1.  **Implement "Deploy New Feature" Workflow:** Implement the full, multi-step workflow defined in the orchestration design document.
## 6. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy is critical to ensure the agent's reliability and security.

### 6.1. Unit Tests
- **Scope:** Individual functions and classes (e.g., a single Temporal activity, a function in a service connector).
- **Tools:** Standard unit testing frameworks (e.g., `pytest` for Python).
- **Goal:** Verify the correctness of individual components in isolation.

### 6.2. Integration Tests
- **Scope:** The interaction between multiple components (e.g., a workflow that orchestrates several activities, the interaction between the orchestrator and Vault).
- **Tools:** Temporal's test framework for testing workflows, `Docker Compose` to spin up dependent services like a local Vault server.
- **Goal:** Verify that components work together as expected.

### 6.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Scope:** A complete workflow, from triggering the initial goal to verifying the final outcome.
- **Environment:** A dedicated, isolated E2E testing environment with real (or near-real) external services.
- **Goal:** Verify that the entire system functions correctly in a realistic environment.

### 6.4. Security Tests
- **Scope:** Actively attempting to bypass security controls.
- **Examples:**
  - Attempting to access a secret from Vault without the correct AppRole.
  - Attempting to execute a destructive action without HITL approval.
  - Attempting to access the host filesystem from the sandboxed environment.
- **Goal:** Proactively identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
3.  **Begin Phased Rollout:**
    - **Phase 1 (Read-Only):** Enable the agent to run read-only tasks (e.g., running tests, previewing infrastructure changes) in a development environment.
    - **Phase 2 (Non-Critical Writes):** Allow the agent to perform non-critical write operations (e.g., creating PRs, updating issues) in the development environment.
    - **Phase 3 (Production Rollout):** After extensive testing and monitoring, gradually enable the agent to perform approved actions in the production environment.
4.  **Gather Feedback:** Continuously monitor the agent's performance and gather feedback from the development team to identify areas for improvement.
