# Sophia Opinion Report v4.2: AI Factory & Projects

**Generated:** 2025-08-21  
**Version:** 4.2.1-alpha  
**Objective:** Design an AI Factory for agentic operations and a unified Projects system to achieve the North Star OKR of **$1,000,000 Revenue Per Employee (RPE)**.

---

## 1. AI Factory (AgentOps) Design

### 1.1. Core Components

- **Agent Registry**: A centralized registry for all AI agents, including their capabilities, versions, and performance metrics.
- **Swarm Lifecycle Management**: Tools for creating, managing, and monitoring agent swarms.
- **Swarm Scheduler**: A scheduler for running swarm missions at specified intervals or on-demand.
- **KPI Dashboard**: A real-time dashboard for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as success rate, p95 latency, and queue depth.
- **Settings & Budgets**: A centralized location for managing budgets, provider routing, and other settings.

### 1.2. User Interface (UI) Design

- **Dark, Modern, Customizable**: The UI should be dark, modern, and customizable, with a focus on usability and clarity.
- **Scalable Layout**: The layout should be scalable to support a growing number of agents, swarms, and missions.
- **Customizable Cards**: Users should be able to add, remove, and reorder cards to create their own personalized dashboards.

## 2. Unified Projects System (Asana + Linear + Notion)

### 2.1. Unified WorkItem Model

- **Objective**: Blend Asana and Linear into a unified WorkItem model with two-way synchronization.
- **Fields**: The WorkItem model should include fields for title, description, status, assignee, due date, and priority.
- **Sync Cadence**: The synchronization cadence should be configurable, with a default of every 5 minutes.
- **Conflict Policy**: A conflict resolution policy should be implemented to handle cases where a WorkItem is updated in both Asana and Linear simultaneously.

### 2.2. Notion OKR Integration

- **Objective**: Pin Notion OKRs at the top of the Projects tab for easy reference.
- **Linkage**: WorkItems should be linkable to specific OKRs to track progress and alignment.
- **RPE North Star**: The system should be explicitly tied to the **$1,000,000 RPE** North Star OKR, with clear visibility into how each project contributes to this goal.

## 3. Integration with Pay Ready

### 3.1. RPE Calculation

- The system should integrate with Pay Ready's financial systems to calculate the RPE in real-time.
- The RPE should be prominently displayed on the AI Factory and Projects dashboards.

### 3.2. Business Intelligence

- The system should provide business intelligence insights into how AI-powered initiatives are impacting the RPE.
- This will enable data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### 4.1. Q3 2025: Foundation & MVP

- Develop the core components of the AI Factory, including the agent registry and swarm lifecycle management.
- Implement the unified WorkItem model with two-way synchronization between Asana and Linear.
- Integrate with Pay Ready's financial systems to calculate the RPE.

### 4.2. Q4 2025: Expansion & Self-Service

- Expand the AI Factory to support a wider range of AI models and use cases.
- Develop a self-service platform that enables developers to easily build and deploy their own AI applications.
- Enhance the Projects system with advanced features such as Gantt charts and resource management.
