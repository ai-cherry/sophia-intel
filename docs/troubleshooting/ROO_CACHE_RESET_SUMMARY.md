# 🔧 Roo Cache Reset Summary - COMPLETED

## ✅ Problem Diagnosis Confirmed

**Root Cause Identified**: Shell/workspace cache misalignment issue
- Python environment was pointing to system Python instead of venv
- VSCode extension caches contained stale data
- Shell integration was interfering with proper environment loading

## ✅ Comprehensive Fix Applied

### Cache Clearing Completed:
- ✅ Cleared Roo extension caches in `~/.vscode-remote/data/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline`
- ✅ Cleared workspace-specific VSCode caches
- ✅ Cleared shell integration cache files
- ✅ Reset terminal integration environment variables

### Environment Alignment Fixed:
- ✅ Python environment corrected: `/workspaces/sophia-intel/venv/bin/python`
- ✅ VSCode settings updated with proper Python interpreter paths
- ✅ Shell integration temporarily disabled for troubleshooting
- ✅ Terminal environment variables properly configured

### File Integrity Verified:
- ✅ `.roomodes` file confirmed valid (ASCII text, 5 modes)
- ✅ All custom modes present and properly formatted:
  - SOPHIA Architect (architect)
  - SOPHIA Feature Builder (builder) 
  - SOPHIA Test Engineer (tester)
  - SOPHIA Operator (DevOps/IaC) (operator)
  - SOPHIA Debugger (debugger)

## 🎯 Current Status: READY FOR TESTING

**Environment Validation Results:**
```
✓ Workspace: /workspaces/sophia-intel
✓ Python environment: /workspaces/sophia-intel/venv/bin/python
✓ .roomodes exists: /workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes
✓ Found 5 custom modes
✓ VSCode settings exist
✓ VSCode Python interpreter aligned
✓ Shell integration disabled (recommended for troubleshooting)
```

## 🚀 FINAL STEPS (Manual Action Required)

### 1. Reload VSCode Window
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Type "Developer: Reload Window"
- Press Enter and wait for reload to complete

### 2. Wait for Extension Loading
- Check the VSCode status bar for extension loading indicators
- Wait until all extensions are fully loaded (no spinning indicators)

### 3. Test Custom Modes
- Open the Roo sidebar (should be on the left panel)
- Click on the mode selector dropdown
- **Expected Result**: You should now see all 5 SOPHIA custom modes:
  - 🏛️ SOPHIA Architect
  - 🏗️ SOPHIA Feature Builder  
  - 🧪 SOPHIA Test Engineer
  - 🛠️ SOPHIA Operator (DevOps/IaC)
  - 🔍 SOPHIA Debugger

### 4. Verify Functionality
- Select one of the custom modes
- Try initiating a conversation
- Confirm the mode-specific context and behavior

## 🔄 If Issues Still Persist

### Escalation Options:
1. **Extension Reset**: Disable and re-enable the Roo extension
2. **Developer Console**: Check F12 Developer Console for JavaScript errors
3. **Complete Restart**: Restart the entire Codespace
4. **Extension Reinstall**: Uninstall and reinstall the Roo extension

### Re-run Validation:
```bash
python validate_roo_env.py
```

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- [`scripts/roo_cache_reset.sh`](scripts/roo_cache_reset.sh) - Comprehensive cache reset script
- [`validate_roo_env.py`](validate_roo_env.py) - Environment validation script

### Modified Files:
- [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json) - Updated with proper Python paths and shell integration settings

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

After completing the manual VSCode reload step, the Roo extension should:
- ✅ Recognize all 5 custom SOPHIA modes
- ✅ Load the correct Python environment
- ✅ Parse the `.roomodes` file successfully
- ✅ Allow seamless mode switching and conversation

## 📞 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- Custom modes appear in the Roo mode selector dropdown
- No more validation errors in the Roo interface
- Mode-specific system prompts and behaviors activate correctly
- Code index search functionality is restored
