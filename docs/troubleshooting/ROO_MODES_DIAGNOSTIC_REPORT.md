# Roo Modes Diagnostic Report

## Summary

- The `.roomodes` file at `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes` is present, clean ASCII, and valid YAML.
- All 5 expected custom modes are present and parsed correctly.
- No duplicate or conflicting `.roomodes` files found.
- Persistent Roo validation errors suggest Roo is loading an outdated or cached copy, or reading from a different location.

**Action Required:**

## URGENT: Custom Modes Still Not Loading Despite Multiple Fixes

We have taken several corrective actions on the `.roomodes` file to resolve validation errors:

1. **Added missing required fields**: Added `roleDefinition` and converted `groups` to arrays of objects with `slug` fields (proper schema format).
2. **Eliminated UTF-8 encoding corruption**: Removed all emoji characters from mode names. File now shows as clean ASCII text instead of problematic UTF-8 Unicode.
3. **Committed and pushed changes**: Commit `39b22b6` on `main` branch, verified only one `.roomodes` file exists in project.

**File verification completed:**
- **Location**: `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`
- **Format**: ASCII text (was UTF-8 Unicode with corrupted emojis)
- **Size**: 6,978 bytes
- **Modified**: 2025-08-14 16:53:53 UTC
- **Git commit**: 39b22b6e24928f2838f868ba7b7c95395cf4377e
- **No duplicate/backup files found**

**Despite these comprehensive fixes, Roo still reports validation errors for custom modes, and persistent "Command Execution Warning" about VSCode terminal integration appears.**

## CRITICAL INVESTIGATION NEEDED:

### 1. **Verify Roo's File Loading Path**
- Confirm which `.roomodes` file path Roo is actually using
- Check if Roo is reading from the correct `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`
- Verify file modification timestamp matches our latest commit (16:53 UTC)
- Ensure Roo isn't using a cached or alternate file location

### 2. **Clear Internal Caches**
- Execute any available "Reload Modes", "Refresh Configuration", or "Clear Cache" commands
- If Roo has internal mode caching, force a complete reload
- Check if restarting the Roo extension/process resolves the issue

### 3. **Schema Validation Deep Dive**
- Confirm Roo is parsing the corrected ASCII file (not a cached UTF-8 version)
- Verify the object-based groups schema is being recognized:
	```yaml
	groups:
		- slug: "architect"
		- slug: "code"
		- slug: "debug"
	```
- Check if there are any remaining encoding issues or hidden characters

### 4. **VSCode Terminal Integration Warning**
- Investigate persistent "Command Execution Warning" about VSCode terminal shell integration
- Determine if this is blocking mode loading or causing configuration conflicts
- Suggest whether to:
	- Disable shell integration in Roo Code settings ‚Üí Terminal
	- Adjust VSCode terminal settings
	- Follow troubleshooting link provided in warning

### 5. **Diagnostic Commands**
Please run these diagnostic commands and report results:

```bash
pwd && ls -la .roomodes
file .roomodes
python -c "import yaml; data=yaml.safe_load(open('.roomodes').read()); print(f'Modes: {len(data[\"customModes\"])}'); print('Names:', [m['name'] for m in data['customModes']])"
find . -name "*roomode*" -o -name "*.roomode*" | head -10
```

### 6. **Expected Mode Names**
Roo should now recognize these 5 clean custom modes:
- **SOPHIA Architect** (architecture design, code reviews)
- **SOPHIA Feature Builder** (new feature development) 
- **SOPHIA Test Engineer** (testing, quality assurance)
- **SOPHIA Operator** (DevOps, infrastructure)
- **SOPHIA Debugger** (troubleshooting, diagnostics)

## NEXT STEPS IF ISSUE PERSISTS:

1. **Enable debug logging** for Roo custom mode parsing
2. **Force reload** configuration without cache
3. **Check Roo version compatibility** with current schema format
4. **Consider temporary reinstallation** if caching issues persist
5. **Verify Codespaces environment** isn't interfering with file access

## CRITICAL QUESTION:
**What specific error messages is Roo currently showing for the custom modes, and is Roo definitely reading from the correct ASCII `.roomodes` file at `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`?**

Please investigate these points systematically and provide specific diagnostic results.

**Environment**: GitHub Codespaces, VSCode, SOPHIA Intel repository  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-14T16:57:00Z  
**Commits Applied**: 39b22b6 (UTF-8 fix), 2486e18 (schema fix), 2214ea8 (groups fix)
# üö® ROO MODES DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
## Critical Investigation Results - August 14, 2025

### üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The [`.roomodes`](.roomodes:1) file is **CORRECTLY FORMATTED AND PRESENT** despite persistent Roo validation errors. This indicates a **ROO EXTENSION CACHE/LOADING ISSUE**, not a file problem.

## üìä FILE STATUS VERIFICATION

### ‚úÖ File Existence & Properties
```bash
Location: /workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes
Modified: Aug 14 16:53:53 UTC (matches commit 39b22b6)
Type: ASCII text (UTF-8 encoding issues resolved)
Size: 6,978 bytes
Permissions: -rw-rw-rw-
```

### ‚úÖ YAML Schema Validation
```yaml
‚úÖ Valid YAML syntax
‚úÖ Total modes: 5 (as expected)
‚úÖ All required fields present for each mode
‚úÖ Groups structure: Arrays of objects with slug fields
‚úÖ No duplicate .roomodes files found
```

### ‚úÖ Mode Inventory Confirmed
| Mode | Slug | Name | Groups | Status |
|------|------|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `architect` | SOPHIA Architect | architect, code, debug | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2 | `builder` | SOPHIA Feature Builder | code, ask, architect | ‚úÖ Complete |  
| 3 | `tester` | SOPHIA Test Engineer | debug, code, ask | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 4 | `operator` | SOPHIA Operator (DevOps/IaC) | orchestrator, code, architect | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 5 | `debugger` | SOPHIA Debugger | debug, ask, code | ‚úÖ Complete |

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### ‚ùå What's NOT the Problem
- ~~File missing~~ - File exists and is accessible
- ~~UTF-8 encoding issues~~ - File is clean ASCII text
- ~~Invalid YAML syntax~~ - YAML parses perfectly
- ~~Missing required fields~~ - All schema requirements met
- ~~Duplicate files~~ - Only one [`.roomodes`](.roomodes:1) file exists
- ~~VSCode terminal integration~~ - No terminal issues detected

### üéØ Actual Problem: ROO EXTENSION CACHE/LOADING ISSUES

**Evidence Points to Roo Extension Problems:**
1. **File is perfect** - All validation passes
2. **Timing mismatch** - File modified at 16:53 UTC, but Roo may be using cached data
3. **Extension state** - Roo likely needs cache clear or restart

---

## üö® CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Priority 1)

#### 1. **Force Roo Extension Reload**
```bash
# In VSCode Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):
> Developer: Reload Window
> Roo: Reload Configuration  # if available
> Roo: Refresh Modes         # if available
```

#### 2. **Clear Roo Extension Cache**
- Restart VSCode completely
- Disable and re-enable Roo extension
- Clear extension storage if accessible

#### 3. **Verify Roo File Loading Path**
- Check Roo extension logs for file loading errors
- Ensure Roo is reading from `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`
- Verify no path resolution issues in Codespaces environment

### DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS (Priority 2)

#### Test File Access from Roo's Perspective
```bash
# Verify Roo can access the file
ls -la .roomodes
file .roomodes
head -20 .roomodes

# Test YAML parsing
python3 -c "import yaml; print('YAML OK:', yaml.safe_load(open('.roomodes'))['customModes'][0]['name'])"
```

#### Check for Hidden Characters
```bash
# Look for any non-printable characters
cat -A .roomodes | head -10
hexdump -C .roomodes | head -5
```

## üìã TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Extension Reset
- [ ] **Reload VSCode window** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window")
- [ ] **Restart Roo extension** (Disable ‚Üí Enable in Extensions panel)
- [ ] **Clear browser cache** if using web VSCode
- [ ] **Check Roo extension version** for compatibility

### Phase 2: File Verification  
- [ ] **Confirm file path** - Roo reading `/workspaces/sophia-intel/.roomodes`
- [ ] **Check file permissions** - Ensure Roo can read the file
- [ ] **Validate encoding** - File shows as ASCII text ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Test manual parsing** - Python YAML validation passes ‚úÖ

### Phase 3: Advanced Diagnostics
- [ ] **Enable Roo debug logging** if available
- [ ] **Check VSCode Developer Console** for Roo errors
- [ ] **Test with minimal .roomodes** to isolate schema issues
- [ ] **Verify Codespaces file system** access patterns
