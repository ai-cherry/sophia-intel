# ðŸš€ Roo Custom Modes Quick Start Prompt

**Copy-paste this prompt to get immediate help after rebuilding your environment:**

---

## My Roo custom modes aren't loading. Run the comprehensive diagnostic and fix process:

1. **Validate current environment** - Check Python path, .roomodes file, and workspace setup
2. **Identify specific issues** - Don't assume, actually test what's broken
3. **Apply targeted fixes** - Clear caches, fix environment alignment, configure shell integration  
4. **Run validation scripts** - Confirm each fix actually worked
5. **Provide exact manual steps** - Tell me exactly what to click/configure in Roo settings UI
6. **Test the final result** - Verify custom modes actually appear and work

**Focus on practical, tested solutions - not theoretical fixes.**

---

## Quick Commands to Run First:

```bash
# Check current status
python validate_shell_integration.py

# If issues found, run the fixes
./scripts/roo_shell_integration_fix.sh

# Validate everything is working  
python validate_roo_env.py
```

## Expected Outcome:
- 5 SOPHIA custom modes visible in Roo mode selector dropdown
- No "Shell Integration Unavailable" errors
- Terminal commands execute properly through Roo
- Mode-specific system prompts activate correctly

**If this doesn't work, debug systematically and provide working solutions.**
