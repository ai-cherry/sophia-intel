**Generated:** 2025-08-21  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Backup Tag:** backup/self-improve-20250821

## Structural Risks Identified

### âœ… High Priority (Completed)
- [x] **Research Service Crashes**: Fixed exit_code=1 crashes with crash-free architecture
- [x] **Service Scaling**: Scaled research service to 3 machines across multiple regions
- [x] **Health Monitoring**: Implemented comprehensive health check systems
- [x] **Context Service**: Deployed and operational with search capabilities

### ðŸ”„ Medium Priority (In Progress)
- [ ] **MCP Context Indexing**: Index endpoint returns 404, needs investigation
- [ ] **Documentation Consolidation**: Multiple README files need unification
- [ ] **Secret Management**: Standardize GitHub Secrets â†’ Pulumi ESC pipeline
- [ ] **CI/CD Optimization**: Reduce GitHub Actions failure rate

### ðŸ“‹ Low Priority (Planned)
- [ ] **One-off Script Cleanup**: Archive scripts older than 90 days
- [ ] **Code Quality Guards**: Implement automated lint and test enforcement
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Update and consolidate requirements.txt files
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation**: Create comprehensive system diagrams

## One-Off Scripts Analysis

### Scripts Requiring Review
- `scripts/` - Contains deployment and utility scripts
- `tools/` - Development tools and helpers
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for analysis

### Action Items
- [ ] Audit script usage and last modification dates
- [ ] Archive unused scripts to `scripts/_archive/`
- [ ] Document active scripts with purpose and ownership

## Missing/Obsolete Documentation

### Documentation Gaps
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Comprehensive endpoint documentation
- [ ] **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- [ ] **Architecture Overview**: System component relationships
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

### Obsolete Documentation
- [ ] Review and update outdated README sections
- [ ] Remove references to deprecated services
- [ ] Update version numbers and compatibility information

## Code Health KPIs to Monitor

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80%+ coverage
- **Lint Issues**: Zero critical lint violations
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Documentation Coverage**: All public APIs documented

### Performance Metrics
- **Service Uptime**: 99.9% target
- **Response Times**: <200ms for health checks, <2s for API calls
- **Error Rates**: <1% for all endpoints
- **Deployment Success Rate**: >95%

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1 (Current)
- [x] Fix critical service crashes
- [x] Implement health monitoring
- [x] Create backup and safety measures
- [ ] Complete MCP context indexing fix

### Week 2
- [ ] Consolidate documentation
- [ ] Implement code quality guards
- [ ] Archive one-off scripts
- [ ] Optimize CI/CD pipelines
