# SOPHIA Model Selection Guide

## Model Selection in Roo

In SOPHIA's Roo integration, model selection is done directly in the Roo UI rather than hardcoded in the repository. This allows each developer to choose their preferred model based on the task at hand.

## Recommended Models

While you have the freedom to choose your preferred models in the Roo UI, here are some recommendations for each mode:

- **🏛️ Architect**: Claude 3 Opus or GPT-4o
- **🏗️ Builder**: Claude 3 Sonnet or GPT-4o
- **🧪 Test Engineer**: Claude 3 Sonnet or GPT-4o
- **🛠️ Operator**: Claude 3 Haiku or GPT-4o
- **🔍 Debugger**: Claude 3 Sonnet or GPT-4o

## Setting Up Models

1. Open the Roo sidebar
2. Select a mode from the dropdown
3. Click the "⚙️" (settings) icon
4. Choose your preferred model from the dropdown
5. Repeat for each mode

This approach allows for easy experimentation with different models for different tasks without requiring code changes.
