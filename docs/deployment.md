# SOPHIA Intel Deployment and Autonomy Tests

## Overview
SOPHIA Intel is a cloud-native AI platform deployed on Fly.io with autonomous development capabilities.

## Current Deployment
- **URL**: https://sophia-intel.fly.dev
- **Status**: Operational
- **SSL**: Built-in Fly.io SSL
- **Image**: sophia-intel:deployment-01K2ZJKWGP3G5Z08V6N4V2J0TJ
- **Machine**: 48e2d02f1d7928

## Bug Fix: To-Do List Persistence
- **Date**: August 18, 2025
- **Issue**: To-do list tasks not persisting after page refresh.
- **Solution**: Implemented localStorage in `apps/frontend/index.html` to save and load tasks.
- **Steps**:
  1. Added `saveTasks` and `loadTasks` functions using `localStorage`.
  2. Updated DOM event listeners to persist tasks on add.
  3. Added task completion and deletion functionality with persistence.
  4. Tested with Playwright to confirm persistence.
- **Status**: Completed, pending PR approval.
- **Logs**: `logs/bug_research_autonomy.log`, `logs/playwright_bugfix_autonomy.log`

## Technical Implementation
### localStorage Functions
```javascript
function saveTasks(tasks) {
    localStorage.setItem('sophia_tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
}

function loadTasks() {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sophia_tasks') || '[]');
}
```

### Task Management
- Tasks are stored as objects with `text` and `completed` properties
- Real-time persistence on add, complete, and delete operations
- Automatic loading on page refresh

## Testing
- Playwright tests verify task persistence across page reloads
- Manual testing confirms localStorage functionality
- Integration with SOPHIA Intel dashboard

## Deployment Process
1. Code changes committed to feature branch
2. PR created for review
3. Automated testing via Playwright
4. Deployment to Fly.io
5. Verification of functionality
