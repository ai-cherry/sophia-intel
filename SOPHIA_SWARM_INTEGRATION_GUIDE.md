- **Claude 4 Sonnet** (0.98 quality) - Code generation, analysis
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (0.97 quality) - Code review, analysis

### **Performance Tier** (Balanced)
- **GPT-4o** (0.95 quality) - Code generation, reasoning
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (0.95 quality) - Reasoning, math, analysis
- **DeepSeek V3** (0.94 quality) - Code specialist, reasoning
- **GPT-5 Mini** (0.92 quality) - General chat, documentation

### **Specialist Models**
- **Qwen Coder 3** (0.90 quality) - Code generation specialist
- **Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B** (0.86 quality) - Code generation
- **DeepSeek Coder** (0.91 quality) - Code review
- **Kimi Moonshot 2** (128k context) - Long context analysis

### **Multi-Criteria Model Selection**
```python
# Sophisticated scoring algorithm considers:
- Task type specialties (code_generation, reasoning, analysis, etc.)
- Quality requirements (basic, good, high, premium)
- Cost preferences (cost_optimized, balanced, performance_optimized)
- Latency requirements (low_latency, normal, batch)
- Function calling & structured output needs
- Historical performance & availability tracking
- Dynamic failure penalties & success bonuses
```

## üîå MCP Server Integration

### **Active MCP Servers**
1. **code-context** - Local code navigation and search
2. **docs-mcp** - Documentation and knowledge search  
3. **github-remote** - GitHub integration via Copilot API

### **Swarm-MCP Integration Flow**

**üèõÔ∏è Initialize SOPHIA Swarm Development Environment**

I need you to help me initialize and test the complete SOPHIA Swarm development environment with all integrations active. Please follow these steps in order:

**Step 1: Environment Validation**
- Check that all 5 Roo custom modes are loaded (.roomodes file)
- Validate MCP server configurations (.vscode/mcp.json)  
- Test code-context MCP server health: `python mcp/code_context/server.py --health`
- Verify swarm integration: Test basic swarm chat functionality

**Step 2: MCP Server Activation**
- Start code-context MCP server (local code navigation)
- Start docs-mcp server (documentation search)
- Verify GitHub remote MCP connection
- Test MCP semantic search functionality

**Step 3: Swarm Integration Test**
- Test swarm chat interface with a simple query
- Verify all 4 swarm agents are responding (architect, builder, tester, operator)
- Validate dynamic AI model selection is working
- Test swarm ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí code context flow

**Step 4: Full Integration Test**
- Create a simple test task that exercises all modes:
  - Architect: Analyze current codebase structure
  - Builder: Suggest a new feature implementation
  - Tester: Identify test coverage gaps
  - Operator: Review deployment configuration
  - Debugger: Check for any integration issues

**Step 5: Coding Readiness Validation**
- Verify I can switch between all 5 Roo modes
- Test that each mode has access to appropriate MCP tools
- Confirm AI model selection is optimized per mode
- Validate that swarm agents can hand off work between modes

**Expected Outcomes:**
‚úÖ All 5 Roo modes active and functional
‚úÖ MCP servers providing context and tools  
‚úÖ Dynamic AI model selection working
‚úÖ Swarm agents coordinating effectively
‚úÖ Full integration: Roo ‚Üî Swarm ‚Üî MCP ‚Üî AI Models
‚úÖ Ready for productive development work

Please run through all these steps and report status of each component, then provide a summary of the fully active development environment ready for coding.

## üéØ Quick Mode Usage Examples

### **Architectural Review**
*Switch to Architect mode*: `"Analyze the swarm integration architecture and suggest improvements"`

### **Feature Development** 
*Switch to Builder mode*: `"Implement a new MCP tool for database operations"`

### **Quality Assurance**
*Switch to Tester mode*: `"Create comprehensive tests for the swarm chat interface"`

### **Infrastructure Management**
*Switch to Operator mode*: `"Review and optimize the MCP server deployment configuration"`

### **Issue Resolution**
*Switch to Debugger mode*: `"Investigate why MCP server connections are timing out"`

## üîÑ Swarm Workflow Integration

When you use any mode, the system:
1. **Selects optimal AI model** based on task type
2. **Activates relevant MCP tools** for context
3. **Coordinates with other swarm agents** if needed
4. **Provides cross-mode handoffs** for complex tasks
5. **Maintains context** across mode switches

This creates a powerful development environment where each mode specializes but they all work together through the swarm coordination system.
