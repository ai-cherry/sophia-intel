# SOPHIA Intel - Autonomous Development Test

## Test Objective
Demonstrate SOPHIA's ability to autonomously:
1. Make code improvements to her own system
2. Commit changes to the correct GitHub repository
3. Deploy changes to production
4. Test and verify the deployed changes
5. Complete the full development lifecycle independently

## Test Plan

### Phase 1: Code Enhancement
- Add a new API endpoint for system statistics
- Enhance the dashboard with real-time status indicators
- Improve error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Repository Management
- Commit changes with proper commit messages
- Push to the correct GitHub repository (ai-cherry/sophia-intel)
- Verify commits are properly recorded

### Phase 3: Deployment
- Deploy changes to Fly.io production environment
- Monitor deployment success
- Verify services remain operational

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
- Test new functionality via live URL
- Verify all existing functionality still works
- Confirm improvements are live and functional

## Success Criteria
✅ Code changes implemented successfully
✅ Changes committed to correct repository
✅ Deployment completed without errors
✅ New functionality accessible via live URL
✅ Existing functionality remains intact

## Test Execution
