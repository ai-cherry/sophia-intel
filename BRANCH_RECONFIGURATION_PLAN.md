## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEW STRUCTURE

### Primary Branches (3)
```
main (stable)
├── Current stable codebase
├── Lambda Labs integration
└── 115 files

production (from notion)
├── Streamlined CLI v3.0.0
├── CEO command center
└── 41 files (minimal, clean)

next (merge ai-swarm + portkey)
├── Advanced features
├── Swarm orchestration
├── Monitoring dashboard
└── ~125 files
```

### Support Branches (2)
```
release/template
├── From ready-to-ship
└── Clean template for deployments

archive/legacy-features
├── autonomous-agent
├── initial-setup
└── Other outdated features
```

## 📝 EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Create New Structure
```bash
# 1. Create production branch from notion
git checkout notion
git checkout -b production
git push origin production

# 2. Create next branch with advanced features
git checkout main
git checkout -b next
git merge feature/ai-swarm-complete-20250812-014035
git merge feature/advanced-portkey-20250812-013430
git push origin next

# 3. Create archive branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b archive/legacy-features
```

### Phase 2: Clean Up Redundant
```bash
# Delete duplicate branches
git branch -D unified-dev
git push origin --delete unified-dev

git branch -D backup/pre-swarm-20250812-013122
git push origin --delete backup/pre-swarm-20250812-013122
```

### Phase 3: Archive Outdated
```bash
# Tag before archiving
git tag archive/autonomous-agent feat/autonomous-agent
git tag archive/initial-setup feat/initial-setup
git tag archive/integration-agno feat/integration-agno

# Delete archived branches
git branch -D feat/autonomous-agent
git branch -D feat/initial-setup
git branch -D feat/integration-agno
git branch -D feat/esc-bootstrap-and-fixes
git branch -D feat/github-security
```

## 🎯 FINAL STRUCTURE

```
sophia-intel/
├── main              [STABLE] Base implementation
├── production        [PROD] Streamlined for deployment
├── next              [DEV] Advanced features & swarm
├── release/template  [TEMPLATE] Clean deployment base
└── tags/
    ├── archive/autonomous-agent
    ├── archive/initial-setup
    └── archive/integration-agno
```

## 🔥 BENEFITS

1. **Clarity**: 3 main branches instead of 12
2. **Purpose**: Each branch has clear role
3. **Speed**: Faster navigation and decisions
4. **Clean**: No duplicate or outdated code
5. **History**: Archived branches preserved as tags

## 🚦 WORKFLOW

```mermaid
main (stable)
  ↓
next (features)
  ↓
production (deploy)
```

### Development Flow:
1. **Feature work** → `next` branch
2. **Testing** → Merge `next` → `main`
3. **Deploy** → Cherry-pick to `production`

## 🛠️ AUTOMATION SCRIPT

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# sophia-branch-reconfig.sh

echo "🎯 Reconfiguring Sophia Intel branches..."

# Create new structure
git checkout notion && git checkout -b production
git checkout main && git checkout -b next
git merge feature/ai-swarm-complete-20250812-014035 --no-edit
git merge feature/advanced-portkey-20250812-013430 --no-edit

# Clean redundant
git branch -D unified-dev backup/pre-swarm-20250812-013122

# Archive old features
for branch in feat/autonomous-agent feat/initial-setup feat/integration-agno; do
  git tag archive/$branch $branch
  git branch -D $branch
done

echo "✅ Reconfiguration complete!"
git branch
```

## 📊 METRICS

### Before:
- 12 branches
- 5 duplicates/redundant
- 4 outdated
- Confusion about which to use

### After:
- 4 active branches
- Clear purpose for each
- Archived history preserved
- Simple workflow

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Review** this plan
2. **Backup** current state
3. **Execute** Phase 1 (create new branches)
4. **Test** new structure
5. **Clean** redundant branches
6. **Document** new workflow

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

Start with Phase 1 to create the new structure without deleting anything. Test for a week, then proceed with cleanup.

The `notion` branch should become your `production` branch - it's the most streamlined (41 files) and has the latest CLI v3.0.0.

The `ai-swarm` features should merge into `next` for advanced development.

Keep `main` as your stable base for now.
