# 🚀 SOPHIA Intel Frontend Deployment Guide

## 📋 **Current Status**
- ✅ **Repository**: Fully committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ **Build**: Successfully builds production assets
- ✅ **Docker**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with nginx ready
- ✅ **Configuration**: Railway deployment config complete
- 🔄 **Deployment**: Ready for Railway GitHub integration

## 🌐 **Target Domain**
- **Primary**: www.sophia-intel.ai
- **API**: api.sophia-intel.ai
- **Backend**: https://sophia-backend-production-1fc3.up.railway.app/ (LIVE)

## 🛠️ **Deployment Methods**

### Method 1: Railway GitHub Integration (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create Railway Project
```bash
# Login to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/
# Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# Select: ai-cherry/sophia-intel
# Set root directory: apps/dashboard
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://sophia-backend-production-1fc3.up.railway.app
```

#### Step 3: Deploy
- Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile
- Build process: Node.js → Vite build → Nginx serve
- Health check: /health endpoint
- Auto-deploy on GitHub pushes

### Method 2: Manual Railway CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login with token
export RAILWAY_TOKEN=32f097ac-7c3a-4a81-8385-b4ce98a2ca1f
railway login

# Navigate to frontend
cd apps/dashboard

# Create new project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Method 3: Docker Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build Docker image
cd apps/dashboard
docker build -t sophia-frontend .

# Test locally
docker run -p 80:80 sophia-frontend

# Deploy to your preferred container platform
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Files**

### Dockerfile (Multi-stage)
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
# Build stage with npm ci and vite build

FROM nginx:alpine
# Production stage with nginx serving
```

### nginx.conf
- SPA routing with fallback to index.html
- Gzip compression for performance
- Security headers
- API proxy to backend
- Health check endpoint

### railway.json
```json
{
  "name": "sophia-intel-frontend",
  "description": "SOPHIA Intel Enhanced Frontend Dashboard",
  "build": { "builder": "DOCKERFILE" },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 30
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **Features Ready for Production**

### ✅ **Enhanced UI Components**
- Beautiful SOPHIA logo with gradient effects
- Modern dark/light theme system
- Responsive design for all devices
- Enhanced chat interface with real-time features

### ✅ **Backend Integration**
- Real-time metrics from production API
- Intelligent chat routing integration
- Health monitoring and status display
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### ✅ **Production Optimizations**
- Gzip compression
- Asset caching strategies
- Security headers
- Performance monitoring
- Health check endpoints

## 🌐 **DNS Configuration**

Once deployed, configure DNS records:

```bash
# CNAME Records for sophia-intel.ai
www     → [railway-frontend-url]
@       → [railway-frontend-url]  
api     → sophia-backend-production-1fc3.up.railway.app
```

## 📊 **Expected Results**

After deployment:
- **Frontend URL**: https://[railway-generated-url]
- **Custom Domain**: https://www.sophia-intel.ai (after DNS)
- **Health Check**: https://[url]/health
- **API Integration**: Connected to production backend

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

1. **Build Verification** ✅
   ```bash
   cd apps/dashboard && npm run build
   # Should complete without errors
   ```

2. **Docker Verification**
   ```bash
   docker build -t sophia-frontend .
   docker run -p 80:80 sophia-frontend
   # Visit http://localhost to test
   ```

3. **Production Verification** (Post-deployment)
   - [ ] Homepage loads with SOPHIA logo
   - [ ] Dashboard tabs function correctly
   - [ ] Real-time metrics display backend data
   - [ ] Chat interface connects to backend
   - [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
   - [ ] Error boundaries handle failures gracefully

## 🚀 **Ready for Deployment**

All configurations are complete and committed to GitHub:
- Repository: https://github.com/ai-cherry/sophia-intel
- Frontend Path: apps/dashboard
- Deployment Method: Railway + Docker + GitHub Integration
- Custom Domain: www.sophia-intel.ai (DNS ready)

**Next Action**: Create Railway project and connect to GitHub repository.
