# .roomodes Investigation Report

## Problem Summary

Your `.roomodes` file is missing from the repository, which is the core configuration file that defines custom Roo modes. Multiple scripts and documentation reference this file, but it doesn't exist in the current codebase.

## Evidence Found

### 1. Documentation References (.roomodes file)
- `docs/roo_code_setup.md:9` - "defined in `.roomodes` (YAML)"
- `docs/roo_code_setup.md:19` - "Ensure it points to `.roomodes` (YAML format)"
- `docs/roo_code_setup.md:139` - "Verify `.roomodes` file exists and is properly formatted"
- `docs/roo_code_setup.md:145` - "**Modes**: `.roomodes` (YAML)"

### 2. Script References (.roomodes file)
- `scripts/setup.sh:36` - "Ensure it points to .roomodes (YAML)"
- `scripts/check_env.sh:81-86` - Health checks for `.roomodes` file
- `scripts/roo_setup.sh:40-42` - Attempts to parse modes from `.roomodes`
- `scripts/roo_troubleshoot.sh:27-34` - Validates `.roomodes` existence
- `.github/workflows/tooling-smoke.yml:9` - CI validation: `test -f .roomodes && grep -q "customModes:" .roomodes`

### 3. Expected Modes (from documentation)
Based on `docs/roo_code_setup.md`, the missing `.roomodes` should contain:

1. **üèõÔ∏è SOPHIA Architect** (slug: `architect`) - Architecture, refactoring, reviews
2. **üèóÔ∏è Feature Builder** (slug: `builder`) - New features and components  
3. **üß™ Test Engineer** (slug: `tester`) - Comprehensive test coverage
4. **üõ†Ô∏è Operator (DevOps/IaC)** (slug: `operator`) - Infrastructure and CI/CD
5. **üîç Debugger** (slug: `debugger`) - Diagnosing MCP/modes/runtime issues

## GitHub Investigation Plan

Using the provided GitHub PAT to search repository history.

### Search Strategy:
1. **Recent Commits**: Search for commits that may have removed `.roomodes`
2. **Branch History**: Check if `.roomodes` exists in other branches
3. **File History**: Look for any trace of `.roomodes` in git history
4. **Pull Requests**: Check recent PRs that might have affected the file

### API Calls to Make:
```bash
# Search for .roomodes in repository content
GET /repos/ai-cherry/sophia-intel/search/code?q=filename:.roomodes

# Get recent commits
GET /repos/ai-cherry/sophia-intel/commits?since=2024-01-01

# List all branches
GET /repos/ai-cherry/sophia-intel/branches

# Search for any mentions of "roomodes" in code/commits
GET /repos/ai-cherry/sophia-intel/search/commits?q=roomodes
```

## Swarm Integration Status

### Working Components:
- ‚úÖ **Swarm Core**: `swarm/` directory exists with complete implementation
- ‚úÖ **Integration Layer**: `integrations/roo_chat.py` exists 
- ‚úÖ **MCP Integration**: Swarm-aware MCP clients in `libs/mcp_client/`
- ‚úÖ **Backend API**: `backend/api/swarm_chat.py` provides REST endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Environment variables and telemetry setup

### Potential Issues:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mode Dependency**: Swarm functionality may depend on Roo modes being properly configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MCP Server Health**: Some MCP servers may not be running or configured correctly

## MCP Server Analysis

### Configured Servers:
From `.vscode/mcp.json`:
- ‚úÖ **code-context**: Local stdio server (`mcp/code_context/server.py`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **github-remote**: HTTP server pointing to GitHub Copilot API

### Missing/Broken:
- ‚ùå **docs-mcp**: Referenced in documentation but missing from config
- ‚ùå **MCP Health Checks**: Scripts reference servers that may not exist

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Immediate Fix**: Create the missing `.roomodes` file with proper YAML structure
2. **GitHub Investigation**: Use the PAT to search repository history 
3. **MCP Validation**: Test all MCP server configurations
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify swarm + roo + MCP integration works end-to-end
5. **Documentation Update**: Fix any stale references found during investigation

## Next Steps

To proceed with the investigation and fixes, I need to switch to **Code mode** to:
1. Create the GitHub investigation script
2. Generate the missing `.roomodes` file
3. Fix any MCP server configurations
4. Run comprehensive tests

Would you like me to switch to Code mode to begin the implementation?
