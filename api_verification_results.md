# SOPHIA Intel API Verification Results

## üö® **VERIFICATION STATUS: ALL ENDPOINTS FAILING**

### **Test Results Summary:**
- ‚ùå Health (HTTPS): Connection failed (000)
- ‚ùå Orchestration (HTTPS): Connection failed (000) 
- ‚ùå Speech (HTTPS): Connection failed (000)
- ‚ùå Direct IP: Connection failed (000)

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Domain Resolution Issue**: www.sophia-intel.ai is not resolving properly
2. **Service Not Deployed**: The enhanced API with orchestration endpoints hasn't been deployed yet
3. **Old API Still Running**: The legacy API without orchestration endpoints is likely still active
4. **Ingress Configuration**: The ingress may not be pointing to the new API service

### **Current Status:**
- The One Interface Scaffold code has been pushed to GitHub main
- The enhanced API with orchestration endpoints exists in the codebase
- The production deployment hasn't been executed via the rescue workflow
- The old API (without orchestration) is likely still running on the cluster

### **Required Actions:**
1. **Deploy Enhanced API**: Run the GitHub Actions rescue workflow to deploy the new API
2. **Update Ingress**: Ensure ingress points to the enhanced API service
3. **Verify Kubernetes Deployment**: Check that the new pods are running
4. **Test Endpoints**: Re-verify all endpoints after deployment

### **Next Steps:**
- Execute Phase 2: Lock in deploy pipeline with proper secrets and Helm values
- Deploy the enhanced API via the rescue workflow
- Update ingress configuration to route to the new service
- Re-test all endpoints to verify orchestration functionality
