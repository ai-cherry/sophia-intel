    - **Business Services Domain** (CRM, communication, project management)
    - **Codebase Domain** (GitHub, development, deployment)
    - **Research Domain** (web intelligence, competitive analysis)
  - How should agent swarms coordinate across domains (e.g., research findings influencing code changes)?
  - What's the optimal hierarchy: Single orchestrator vs. Domain supervisors vs. Peer-to-peer coordination?
  - How should agent swarms handle conflicting priorities from different business domains?
  - What patterns exist for agent handoff and context preservation across domain boundaries?

### **3. Unified Interface Design**
- **Question**: How can a single conversational interface provide contextualized access to all domains without overwhelming users?
- **Sub-questions**:
  - What conversation routing patterns work best for multi-domain AI systems?
  - How should the system determine which business services to query based on natural language input?
  - What context switching mechanisms allow seamless transitions between business domains?
  - How should the interface handle complex queries that span multiple domains (e.g., "analyze client health using Gong calls, HubSpot data, and competitive research")?
  - What personalization patterns adapt the interface to different user roles (CEO, developer, sales, support)?

### **4. User-Based Configuration & Permissions**
- **Question**: What architectural patterns support dynamic, role-based access to business services and AI capabilities?
- **Sub-questions**:
  - How should user roles and permissions be modeled across multiple business services?
  - What configuration patterns allow users to customize their AI agent behavior per domain?
  - How should the system handle different permission levels across integrated services?
  - What patterns support team-based configurations vs. individual preferences?
  - How should audit trails and compliance be handled across all integrated services?

### **5. Data Flow & Context Management**
- **Question**: How should data flow and context be managed across business services, AI agents, and user interactions?
- **Sub-questions**:
  - What data synchronization patterns work best for real-time business intelligence?
  - How should the system handle data consistency across multiple business service APIs?
  - What caching and indexing strategies optimize performance across all domains?
  - How should sensitive business data be isolated while maintaining cross-service insights?
  - What patterns support both real-time and batch processing of business data?
